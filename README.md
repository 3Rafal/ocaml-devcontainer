# OCaml Dev Container

A basic dev container for OCaml development. It is based on the latest stable versions of OCaml and Debian.

Current configuration supports simple workflow of:
- Editing code using [OCaml Platform VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ocamllabs.ocaml-platform)
- Package management using [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org)
- Building projects using [Dune](https://dune.build)
